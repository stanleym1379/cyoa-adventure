**It's getting closer!!! This just ruined your perfect day...**   
**"I should've stay in New York", you think to yourself...**  
**You try your best to escape from the wild animal...**
### You're so close to safety!!! You actually might survive this!!!
## Suddenly you feel a yank on your leg.. OH NO, It's got you.. It mauls and kills you savagely... your perfect vacation has come to a morbid end... you have DIED.  

**Will your family miss you? Probably not...**
