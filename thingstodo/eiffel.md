**You arrive excitedly to the Eiffel Tower.**  
You're mesmorized from how tall it is!  
You run to the front. You take a big picture first and you plan on going to eat dinner in the Eiffel Tower.  

#### You get on the elevator to the restaurant. The restaurant is on the top! So exciting!!! You're going to be able to try snails...  
### You've made it to the top.. Paris is so beautiful, the lights are bright and the people look like ants... 
#### Your table is ready... you take a seat and order some snails and a fancy glass of red wine.. Your order of snails is taking long so you order two more cups of wine... you're feeling a little tipsy now.. you decided to look over the edge.. you lean a little too over and you..
