You take a rented Jeep and you head to the dunes of the desert of Arizona.  
**As you explore the hot and dry desert, you see the breathtaking views of mountains.**  
You take a few pics for your Instagram... and drink some water cause that heat is unforgiving...  
**Night is coming and you decide to view the stars and enjoy the sight...**  
**It's time to head back to your hotel... It's super cold and you don't have any warm clothes...**

### In the last minute, you see a animal you've never seen before. You use your binoculars to take a closer look... It's a Mountain Lion!!! The animal is angry and comes [charging your way](animal.md).
